# Python_Machine-Learning
It contains different types of machine learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering techniques, etc

# Linear Regression
It contains the **Linear Regression model** and **Statistical model** for predicting the sales and Tuned using **Ridge & Lasso** (Tunning Technique for Linear Regression) and **Assumptions of Linear Regression**.

# Logistic Regression
It contain **Logistic Regression model** and tuned that model by **Adjusting the threshold**, performed **AUC Curve** for decide between multiple threshold, Cross Validation like **K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold**. <br>
Performed Feature Selection using **ResursiveFeatureSelector, SequentialFeatureSelector**. Univariate Analysis like **SelectKBest, Chi-Square and Variance Threshold.**

# Decision Tree
It contains **Decision Tree Model** and other models like **Extra Trees, Random Forest, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC and Logistic Regression** for **Car Price Prediction**.
Implemented Base Decision Tree having accuracy of **97.83%**, then we have Tuned the Decision Tree having accuracy of **96.02%**, and lastly we have implemented Logistic regression having accuracy of **64.62%**. Hence, We have conclude that the Base Decision has the Highest Accuracy of **97.83%**.
